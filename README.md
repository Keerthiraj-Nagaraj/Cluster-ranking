# Cluster-ranking
 Cluster ranking using Spectral clustering and Eigenvector centrality
 
 
In the recent past, network sciences has gained prominent position in data analysis. One of the main reasons being the correctness in representation of various networks like social networks, transportation networks, communication networks using concepts of network sciences. Most of the networks operate in hierarchical structure where they are divided into different communities based on similarity between different network nodes. Analyzing clusters is the first step to understand the behavior of the whole network. Identifying the clusters with utmost importance to the network plays a major role as it has applications such as understanding the vulnerability of transportation networks, resource optimization among communication networks. In this mini project, the implementation of one of the popular
clustering algorithms known as Spectral clustering which can be used to divide a given network into various clusters is discussed.
Finally, one of the centrality measures known as Eigenvector centrality is calculated for all network nodes. These values are utilized to rank the clusters identified using spectral clustering.
